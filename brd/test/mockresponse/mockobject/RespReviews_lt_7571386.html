The instructions with the contest suggest it be put on a special "First Reads" shelf, and then read and review it...<br><br>Could I give it less than one star? A quick look plot teaser on the cover of "The Gnostic Mystery" is reminiscent of a Dan Brown novel. The protagonist finds himself unexpectedly thrust into danger as he solves some mystery about the ancient Christian church. It is anything but this, however.<br><br>Looks can be deceiving, and the similarities with "The Da Vinci Code" or "Angels and Demons" are almost non-existent. As soon as Davila has enough plot to lay a foundation (the first 10-20 pages), the plot stops, almost completely, and the polemic begins. As if that was not enough, the plot that he does include jumps around chronologically, and unnecessarily, confusing and distracting the story. While one flashback might be acceptable, the story jumps forward and backward, and without any real flashbacks at all. Changes in the story time are indicated with large bold type "Three days earlier" or "Present day," but with a disjointed effect that hurts, not helps, the story. When the jumps in time suddenly end, at about the same time the plot slows to a glacial crawl for the duration of the book, it is a relief.<br><br>However, the end of the jumping indicates something else, also: the end of the plot. With no real tension or conflict between the characters or in the plot, and with the modicum of plot out of the way, Davila gets to work on what appears to be his real purpose all along: a polemic against the miracles, virgin birth, death and resurrection, and atonement of Jesus Christ. Attributing these "myths" to the manipulation of Eusebius and Constantine, Davila proceeds to spend the lion's share of the book with conversations between an a Catholic "believer" and a seasoned academic. Their discussion of about faith is really the process of the academic disabusing the believer of his faith that Jesus was divine or that the circumstances around his life were touched by the divine. In the final analysis, by Davila's estimation, Jesus was at best a teacher and an amalgamation of pagan beliefs with a revolution in spiritual beliefs, a confluence of the mythology and power of Zeus and Apollo on one side and the morality and gentility of Buddha on the other.<br><br>And did I mention there's almost no plot against which this boring polemic is set? What plot there is amounts, at best, to a Family Feature Film, lacking tension or conflict.<br><br>In the end, I finished it just to see where Davila would take his arguments against organized religion. As I come from a Restoration perspective established on roots not connected to the events that resulted in the modern Catholicism, I did not have any problem seeing the events of the early Christian church that Davila describes in the light of what I know. What Davila describes with his limited research is what we now know to have been general apostasy of the church in the centuries after Christ and his apostles. It was no test to my faith, nor do I think someone who roots their faith in, surprise surprise, faith, in contrast to archeological research, would find their faith tested either. His arguments are heavily one sided, superficial, and would make great paper tigers for a real discussion by persons representing both sides (Hugh Nibley would get a kick out of this).<br><br>All that said, I don't recommend you waste time with this book. It is boring, lacks character or plot development, and is a polemic disguised as a novel. Go read Dan Brown if you want a mystery about the Catholic church. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss2.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_101260059" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_101260059">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_101260059" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_101260059" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_101260059"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/publiusdb" target="_top">publiusdb</a> | Aug 22, 2013 |  <a href="/review/101260059"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_100611725" class="commentText">I have to say that I was a bit disappointed in the book. While I have to give kudos to the author for his vast knowledge on the subject and his obvious research, I felt as though the story itself was written simply to convey the information which he had gathered. I do not wish to say that the author is wrong or that I am offended with his approach to the subject. On the contrary, I found the "academic" information to be quite well written and understandable. It was when the story turned to the actual events and activities of the characters themselves that the story and writing was lacking. The dialogue between the various characters seemed so contrived - so fake and forced. And I also felt that the "mystery" itself was weakly developed. I liked the premise of the story, but I felt it was still in the outline stage rather than a finished product. So much more could have happened and the conclusion was so nice and neat and quickly cleaned up. I was left wanting more of a story rather than a shell of a story with a lot of information piled on top. <br><br>I think this was a good first attempt at a novel and if he only more fully develops the characters and the story itself in the next installment (if there is to be one), then the book will be much better. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss4.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_100611725" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_100611725">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_100611725" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_100611725" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_100611725"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/mlh2" target="_top">mlh2</a> | Aug 7, 2013 |  <a href="/review/100611725"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_96568445" class="commentText">I received this free, so forced myself to read through to the end.

Davila's goal seems to be to make others aware of the Gnostic Gospels, but by divulging that in such an elementary style, it causes the reader to doubt his expertise in the subject. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss2.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_52679037" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_52679037">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_52679037" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_52679037" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_52679037"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/BallyMan" target="_top">BallyMan</a> | Nov 2, 2009 |  <a href="/review/52679037"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_47252712" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>It's funny, I reviewed this book back in July after finishing, and posted it! But just got a note today that it wasn't here and I had to review. So here is a BRIEF review as I don't want to write the entire thing out again.<br><br>This book had potential to be a good book. I figured it would be something like a Dan Brown book: full of facts and a great mystery story that kept the reader entertained and turning pages. I was sadly mistaken.<br><br>I found this novel to be a venue for the Author to give a personal lecture on the information of the Gnostics instead of portraying it as a novel. I fought my way through to the end hoping that it would get better. I think that this book would be better as a non fiction so that the author would have full attention on his ideas. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss4.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_47252712" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_47252712">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_47252712" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_47252712" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_47252712"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/Platygirl" target="_top">Platygirl</a> | Oct 27, 2009 |  <a href="/review/47252712"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_51617609" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>I have to agree with some of the reviews I've read that this book just sort of throws information at you without a well-done narrative structure.

If I ever had a friend who incessantly lectured me in every conversation the way characters in this book do, (ie: Chloe), my story would likely be about an aggravated assault. <br><br> Put together with such a polemical and remarkably inaccurate revisionist picture of the formation of the Christian church, ('Many scholars' do NOT believe this stuff), The Gnostic Mystery resembles an undergraduate mind attempting to link the dots of material they don't actually understand. <br><br> To the point, the revelations of various 'facts' in this book are consistently framed by the tone of great discovery. Certain characters make declarations, and everyone else responds with wondrous surprise or eager questions for more. The impression given is that the authour thinks he is actually revealing something tremendous or significant that heretofore has been hidden away. For example, quoting randomly from almost any page in the book, like page 187: "'What?' Punjeeh asked incredulously, further puzzled by her . . ." <br><br> Ironically, (and painfully), this book actually contains nothing significant, and certainly nothing that's new - (His bibliography of 27 books includes 4 by Pagels, and 1 by Tom Harpur) - except of course for the material that Davila has simply made up. In the end, Davila actually has to create a fictitious Gnostic document to make his point. Why? Because real Gnostic material does not say what his personal issues need it to say. Since reality won't give him a legitimate basis for his revisionist fantasy, he has to fake it to contest for his own whipped up version of Gnostic thought and history.<br><br> It's worth saying that the real work of a religious or spiritual thinker is to struggle through the questions of fear and guilt that his character Jack says he never understood in "traditional church teaching". One cannot simply avoid or drop them. And so instead of creating fictional religious alternatives that 'feel' better to his 21st century vanities, he would do well to dig into those areas which really are a mystery to him. <br><br> But I suspect that Davila isn't actually interested in mystery at all. Instead, his real interest is in being the one majestically to dispel 'mysteries' for everyone else, even if he has to make them up in the first place. He's been reading Harpur for sure . . . <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss1.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_46608881" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_46608881">1</span> <img title="1 member found this review helpful" id="rvi_46608881" alt="vote" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/voteup-y.gif"></span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_46608881" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_46608881" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_46608881"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/PastorBob" target="_top">PastorBob</a> | Sep 30, 2009 |  <a href="/review/46608881"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_51421896" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>While I am certainly not hostile to either organized religion or gnosticism, this is not a particularly good book either as a novel or as a thinly disguised polemic on religion.

This is exactly like that, but with religion.<br><br>I wanted to like this book. I have an interest in religion and in the Gnostics in particular. But the writing style just didn't do it for me. I didn't care about the characters (except to be annoyed, with Jack in particular) and the plot was almost nonexistent. Subtract the bombings and you could almost substitute it for an unfunny sitcom episode. Also, any semblance of plot ends about forty pages before the book does, and from there on out it's just speechifying about Gnosticism.<br><br>It seems to me that Mr. Davila is passionate about what he believes, and that's a good thing, but putting it into the framework of a novel would've taken a gentler hand to turn out interesting. If you can see that an author is trying really hard to do something (in this case, create suspense, with the short chapters and the jumping around in time) they're not succeeding at it. Also, there's nothing wrong with the word 'said.' Characters don't need to spend all their time exclaiming and remarking and making faces every time they say something.

Parts of the story line were excellent and I would have loved to see them developed; other parts were poorly written and slow moving The characterizations of the Palestinian boys were well drawn; other characters relied on overly heavy descriptions and stereotypes.

While rekindling his faith in Catholicism, he buys an old scroll from a Palestinian boy. After having it translated by an attractive religion professor named Chloe, who despite being Greek and living in Jerusalem and maybe never visiting an Anglo-speaking country, has a perfect grasp of the English language, it turns out to be part of the Gnostic Mystery scroll. From there, Chloe educates Jack and his friend Punjeeh on the similarities of the Bible with ancient myths, concentrating mostly on Greco-Roman ones.<br><br>The book gives a detailed account of the Gnostics' position in the early church, but there is so much of it that it can be hard to digest. Also, the style is very didactic despite the Socratic method of questioning in order to break up the monotony of Chloe's lectures. On the other hand, the book gives a selective bibliography in case somebody wishes to pursue the matter more.

Randy Davila is an excellent writer, but this book just didn't go anywhere and insults his readers' intelligence, hence my two-star rating for good writing, a good idea for a plot, no action, and assuming the ignorance of his readers.<br><br>The book lacked action and really seemed to be a lecture on what I should believe about Biblical history. However, that's not why I wanted to read the book; I expected something more along the lines of David Gibbins, and that was a terrible mistake. This book is mostly lecture, and no offense, but I'd rather go to lectures by Bart Erhman as I did in college; Prof. Erhman did not assume I was completely ignorant where Davila did. In addition, Erhman's lectures were always highly entertaining, and I cannot say the same of Davila's. Davila treats his readers as if we haven't a clue about Biblical scholarship or much of anything. This is not my field, but I knew much more than his high flying, supposedly well educated characters. <br><br>If this book were re-worked, made to be faster paced, less preachy/lecture-y -- it would be a winner. This would require more action, more character development, and more excitement.

Throughout most of the book the narrative focuses on an American travel named Jack, but several other characters play an important role as well. The book focuses on two aspects: the discovery and transaction of the scrolls themselves, and (more importantly) the content within these scrolls, produced by the ancient Gnostic Christians and highlighting some of the doctrines they believed in. <br><br>The books seems to focus a great deal on the discussions between the characters about the history of Gnosticism and its eventual decline during the early years of Christianity. I definitely found the theological discussions interesting. Keep in mind that the perspective of the book is pretty much pro-Gnostic, so it's possible that some readers who have a very traditional theology will raise their eyebrows at some of the concepts. An appendix of the book includes several sources as well, so that one who is interested in the topics in the book can continue to explore more of the Gnostic history and theology.<br><br>The main disadvantages of the book? I thought the plot itself was simplistic and somewhat predictable. The most bothersome aspect is that during the theological conversations, whenever one of the characters makes an interesting point, the other characters go out of their way to praise him or her. This was excusable at first, but around the end of the book, when Jack begins to understand the theology of the Gnostics and mentions his understanding, he is complemented extremely frequently! This bothered me.<br><br>Other than that, I liked the book. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss7.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_49136401" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_49136401">1</span> <img title="1 member found this review helpful" id="rvi_49136401" alt="vote" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/voteup-y.gif"></span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_49136401" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_49136401" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_49136401"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/benfergy" target="_top">benfergy</a> | Aug 11, 2009 |  <a href="/review/49136401"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45765829" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>Overall, I would say I liked this book and it was worth reading. However, I really think the author should have divided it into 2 separate books. I think the fiction part was done well and would have been an enjoyable read had he developed that storyline more. I think the fact part of the book should have been a non-fiction book. The information he tells the reader is great and you can tell he did a lot of research to give such detail.<br><br>But, I really didn't like the delivery of the information. First off, the dialogue in the scholarly part of the book was just plain terrible. The four main characters were two grown men in their 30's who grew up Roman Catholic and then there were two professors of religion. While the professors were explaining everything about the history behind the origins of Christianity to the two men, I kept "forgetting" that this was an intelligent adult conversation - the two men really seemed like naive children. And the professor's "teaching" just really felt like they were putting on a documentary for children who really had no clue and needed things to be spelled out and explained simplistically.<br><br>It really is curious how different the dialogue was between the novel part and the scholarly part of the book! It almost felt like two different authors. Nearly EVERYTIME Punjeeh would address his longtime friend Jack, he would say "my friend". That's just not natural speech. "My friend" should really be reserved to express closeness at a really intense moment. And they both seemed just so incredibly naive! I don't think that two people who grew up in the Roman Catholic would be "that" clueless about some of the information, not to mention that Punjeeh was actually a doctor, a medical doctor, but still someone who had received a lot of schooling nonetheless.<br><br>Now, I really really enjoyed learning facts about the history of the church that I didn't know - some of it I already knew. In a way, I think the dialogue "had" to be so simplistic in order to enable the professors to adequately explain the facts so that a reader of any level could understand thoroughly. But, as I said earlier, I think that information would have been much more enjoyable to read in a non-fiction setting.<br><br>Many readers have been offended by the scholarly information dispensed, others have appreciated the information like I have. I think the author did an excellent job of getting the facts out all-the-while respecting how hard it is for some Christians to hear the information. I don't think the author dealt with the information in an insulting way at all. It's simply that some of the historical facts discussed will be shocking to some readers.<br><br>If you're looking for a good suspenseful read - I would pass this book up; if you're not comfortable reading information that might confuse the current view of your faith - I would pass this book up. If you are okay with learning some challenging information about the origins of your faith, then read this book. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss6.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45765829" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45765829">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45765829" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45765829" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45765829"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/DelennDax7" target="_top">DelennDax7</a> | Aug 10, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45765829"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_47562279" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>I, like others, was ready for a good book weaving in history with a mystery.

There are no thrills in the book, and few redeeming features.<br> <br>The story goes back and forth between the lives of two Palestinian teenagers who discover ancient scrolls in a cave near the Dead Sea, and an incredibly clueless, yet very successful and rich, American businessman visiting Israel. The boys who discovered the scrolls hide them in a tree, from which they are stolen and sold to tourists by a cousin of one of the boys. One of the tourists is the American businessman, who ends up showing it to an attractive (of course) religious scholar who translates the scroll and explains in nauseating and elementary detail its significance as an Early Christian Revelation. The rest of the story concerns finding the second scroll (sold to a schoolteacher from Baltimore) and more dumbed-down explanations of Early Christian beliefs. <br><br>The characters in this short novel are really only there so that the author can write a book about Gnostic beliefs. It just barely hangs together as a novel because the characters are so poorly written. The Palestinian teenagers might as well be Texan or Iowan. There is nothing in their behavior that sets them apart from poorly written American teenagers. The businessman is supposed to be very successful and smart, but comes across as very ignorant and naïve. There is no real action in the book, and certainly no suspense, so comparing it to The Da Vinci Code, as the blurb on the jacket does, is highly misleading. Here’s an example of some of the dialogue:<br><br>““Let’s open it up,” Caleb said.<br>“Do we have to?” Youseff pleaded…<br>“These could be valuable ancient writings,” Caleb said…<br>“Oh, stop being such a baby,” Caleb scoffed, “and lets head back. I want to take it to the antique shop and find out what it is.””<br><br>““An ancient letter from the Gnostics,” Punjeeh exclaimed, “What a find, Jack!”<br>Jack stared blankly across the desk at Chloe, Punjeeh, and Professor King. He was really feeling like a first grader in this group. Finally he had to ask, “So who the heck were these guhnostiks?” He deliberately pronounced the silent G.”<br><br>The best thing about this book was that it wasn’t very long, only 197 pages. It was very poorly written, and had hardly any plot. It does contain a bibliography with works I recognize from noted Gnostic scholars, and I did actually learn some things from the book that I hadn’t known before; however, I prefer to learn about religion from non-fiction books. I like to read novels for pleasure, especially when they’ve been compared to The Da Vinci Code. This wasn’t a pleasurable read, and I only slogged through it so I could write a review for the LibraryThing.com Early Reviewers Group. I don’t recommend this book, but do recommend a book for people who might be looking for a different interpretation of Jesus’ life: The Secret Magdalene by Ki Longfellow. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss2.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45154951" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45154951">1</span> <img title="1 member found this review helpful" id="rvi_45154951" alt="vote" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/voteup-y.gif"></span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45154951" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45154951" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45154951"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/janoorani24" target="_top">janoorani24</a> | Aug 6, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45154951"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_48842480" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>As I am very fascinated with Gnosticism and other people's opinions of it (who the Gnostics were is certainly a source of contention is academia!), I was very interested to read this book.

It's not intended to be a scholarly work, but the author has done his research and his views on Gnosticism are clear throughout.

In fact, this is mainly a long exposition on the Gnostic Christians, dressed up in a very small tale of two Palestinian boys finding an ancient scroll and hawking it to tourists. We learn about the Gnostics through Chloe Eisenberg, a professor of philosophy and religion, who spends much of the novel enlightening our hero, wealthy young stockbroker Jack Stanton. Jack has come to Jerusalem to renew/explore his faith, and unfortunately he has to appear to be incredibly naive and uneducated in order for the exposition to occur. The book was interesting enough (I learned a few things), but it was not mystery fiction, and barely even fiction at all.</div><div id="rfd_48273022" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_48273022">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_48273022" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_48273022" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_48273022"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/candyschwartz" target="_top">candyschwartz</a> | Jul 25, 2009 |  <a href="/review/48273022"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_44962225" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>Pleasant,but lightweight.

Not a great one but without a doubt a good one. This is one of those novels trying to emulate the "Da Vinci Code" in more ways than one. Nothing wrong with writing what people apparently want to read. You aren't going to get very far write what people don't want to read. However this does limit the subject or subjects, and form that one can use in building your plot.<br><br> This is Mr. Davila's first novel after being a short story author and to certain extent it shows. The plot, the characters of this book all seem to secondary to the information that he wants to impart to us about the Gnostics and Gnosticism.. <br><br> If I wasn't so steeped in many areas of Gnosticism I would have found this very educational.and very much enlightening. He should have concentrated a bit more on his framework development and given more life to his characters. To make them so that we might be able to better sympathize, empathize, and feel more involved in them and the book. . <br><br> As it is, I wasn't absorbed into the book as much as I would have expected to be.

His use of modern events as a commentary also detracts from his primary goal of explaining the Gnostic movement. He does little to explain how the modern elements are relevant to the spiritual storyline. In the end this book was too disjointed to make it a good read for someone interested in the Gnostic Movement. In addition, the used of too much jumping back and forth in the timeline between when the scrolls are found to when they are revealed makes it hard for the average reader to enjoy. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss3.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_48084667" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_48084667">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_48084667" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_48084667" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_48084667"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/AtheneSolon" target="_top">AtheneSolon</a> | Jul 21, 2009 |  <a href="/review/48084667"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_48048543" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>The plot is simple, a wealthy American, Jack Stanton. travels to Israel to visit his old college classmate Punjeeh Kohli who is a Doctor in Israel and also to find out why he now seems so different.

Each new exposure of Church history results in the incredulous surprise of one or the other of the male characters.

There seems to be a problem with what audience is being written for. The book wants to start off as a thriller, but instead turns into a somewhat involved (and dry) tract on gnosticism. This eliminates the people looking for a religious thriller. At the same time the level of discussion isn't really at the level of someone who would actively seek out a book on gnosticism. This book either needs more plot, or to beef up it's research and be straight non-fiction.

I did not give it more because the whole premise leaves a lot to be desired. Davila does not just call for a suspension of disbelief as you read but a conversion to his paradigm. It wasn’t until page 64 that this novel began to really make sense. As one of the characters says, “This whole discussion is starting to sound like an ideological fantasy.” Davila has a clear agenda in writing this novel and it is not to entertain readers. As a blurb on the back states “Randy Davila uses fiction to tell the truth—and it is an eye opening experience.” Unfortunately, this agenda drives the novel resulting in a finished product that is neither well developed fiction nor full of truth.<br><br>The characters dash madly around Jerusalem and Bethlehem chasing a fictitious Gnostic scroll which will reveal all mysteries about the Christian religion. Davila makes points by setting up ‘straw men’ such as the date of Christmas. The main character Jack is shocked to learn that Jesus was not actually born on December 25. Davila has made Jack a somewhat lapsed Roman Catholic which is fortunate as Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on January 6 and would hardly be surprised. From such “shocking revelations” that everyone examining the evidence can agree with he moves to claiming that the birth narrative itself is fictitious and Jesus was not born to a virgin in either a cave or a manger. In fact all of the early Christians were actually Essene Jews who evolved out of Judaism into Gnosticism. His only evidence for most of these points is that “the Gnostics claimed such and such” or there are parallels between this Christian practice and some pagan practice. Each time the pagan practice is from a different century in a different part of the ancient world so it is not entirely consistent.<br><br>One of the major difficulties with Davila’ view about Gnostic origins and his claims about the Apostle Paul is the fact that Paul states in 1 Corinthians 15:12ff that if in fact Jesus did not die and rise from the dead then “our preaching is useless and so is your faith.” Gnostic Christianity did not fail just because it was persecuted, it failed because it had no risen saviour who had literally died and risen from the dead to provide a model for followers that they too would have eternal life. Gnosticism also lacks the power of Holy Spirit to enable people to live as Christ did. It is not enough to just point to Jesus as a model to follow; people have to have some way of accomplishing that.<br><br>For those who would like another view of Jesus and the “historical facts” that Davila presents in this novel I would suggest Lee Strobel’s book The Case for Christ. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss3.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_47872817" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_47872817">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_47872817" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_47872817" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_47872817"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/True54Blue" target="_top">True54Blue</a> | Jul 16, 2009 |  <a href="/review/47872817"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_47868377" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>I received this book as an early reviewer--and began it with an open mind.

The writing was so basic, I started to wonder if, in fact, it was intended to be a children's book. If so, it could be considered quite a good introduction to the subject matter.<br>It bothered me that these apparently well-educated people (Jack and his friend) who had both been raised as Catholics, seemed to be quite ignorant of many ideas. As intellectuals, the continuous comments about their understanding something which was very simple was annoying and seemed to be more to reassure the reader that yes it WAS complicated but you might figure it out eventually, just like these guys - a bit patronizing possibly. Their shock reactions at much of what Chloe and the professor presented to them became quite tedious. I have read several books on Gnosticism and have seen a couple of popular documentaries on the lost Gospels and similar themes over the last few years so this is not the preserve of a few academics any more.<br>I read most of this book in one sitting. I found the writing very amateurish which is a shame as the author clearly knows his subject well. The various threads had so much potential but just did not go far enough. The first trip to the Dead Sea fell flat for me. I so wanted to be told what it looked like! Instead there was a lecture about the salt content and why it is called dead which I think most people know. Why did the American tourist have an artificial leg? Was it just because it made it easier to look for her later or was there supposed to be some deeper meaning bound up in the mistake of thinking a different woman with a leg problem was the one they were seeking? I think there was an attempt to ascribe all sorts of significance to characters and situations in order to bring depth to this story but I do not think it worked. There is a series of Book Club questions at the end of the book that are so much 'heavier' than the story itself that it quite surprised me.<br>I get the impression this book was either very deliberately 'dumbed-down' to, I suppose, reach a wider audience or written very quickly. In any case, it just did not quite work for me, unfortunately. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss5.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_47845479" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_47845479">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_47845479" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_47845479" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_47845479"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/rosiezbanks" target="_top">rosiezbanks</a> | Jul 16, 2009 |  <a href="/review/47845479"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_47523688" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>I really tried to get into this book ... unfortunately, it wasn't an academic discussion of Gnostism (which would have been OK with me), and it certainly wasn't a Dan Brown story. <br><br>I didn't care for the characters (no dislike here, just apathy), and the story just wasn't entertaining. <br><br>I would have rather read a short thesis on Gnostism than this.

Two scrolls surface variously in the Dead Sea area which show that the Jesus of Christianity is not the real Jesus of 2,000 years ago. The wording from these two scrolls are printed in large italic type towards the front and back of the novel.<br><br>The novels presents some intellectual arguments for gnosticism, but does not take us into gnosticism as a lived faith. Normative Christianity is described almost perjoratively as the literalist church. Among scholars there is a much greater sympathy to gnosticism, and this book's bibliography gives a number of references in the back. My problem with this book is that the two stances are taken as an either/or philosophy, but I believe one can see the mystery and wisdom traditions that existed at the time of Christ can inform what Christianity has received either in scripture or tradition. This is not a bad book, it's just not truly convincing. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss7.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_47167447" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_47167447">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_47167447" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_47167447" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_47167447"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/vpfluke" target="_top">vpfluke</a> | Jul 12, 2009 |  <a href="/review/47167447"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45499616" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>The Gnostic Mystery is not well-written. That said, I rather enjoyed reading it. The plot surrounds American tourist Jack, come to visit his old college roommate, now an ER doc in Jerusalem, and re-connect with his Catholic faith. With the help of some Palestinian teens, Jack discovers a ancient scroll, and most of the book then subsides into a series of good-natured lectures as a beautiful Isreali scholar enlightens Jack as to ancient religions, the premises of Gnostic Christianity, and his discovery's translation. Jack's reactions as his faultering faith is challenged again and again are, alas, unrealistically sensible. Still, author Randy Davila does a good job of synthesizing the perspectives of scholars and writers who have researched Gnostic Christianity (Elaine Pagels and Bart D. Ehrman for two), adding in a few dollops of his own. It's a pleasure to think that greater historical understanding of Christianity's (and other religions') beginnings might indeed lead to a rational and fulfilling personal philosophy and even perhaps greater peace in this world. If you're on your own faith journey, or if you're looking for an easy-to-read introduction to some Gnostic precepts, you might be interested in The Gnostic Mystery. If you're looking for a well-plotted, suspenseful thriller that's rich with historical detail, try Dan Brown.</div><div id="rfd_45499616" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45499616">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45499616" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45499616" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45499616"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/hmajor" target="_top">hmajor</a> | Jul 12, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45499616"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_47635737" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>Surprising and refreshing, this book looks at the early history of Christianity. I was fearing a rehashed Da Vinci Code but was drawn instead into a new perspective of religious history and philosophy. The author takes the time to start from the beginning with simple and thorough explanations and slowly builds on these, culminating in the promise for more. In that respect the book is carefully constructed, easy to follow and the reader is enticed into the story as it unfolds in a mystery of sorts and a search for new interpretations.<br><br>There is a flaw however. I found the characters underdeveloped, Jack too naive and Chloe too doctoral - one sometimes really had the impression of reading a lecture taught to a dull-witted student. While the plot was simple yet well thought-out, the dialogues felt stilted even at times contrived. Nonetheless, this book is a delightful introduction to a little-known and often misunderstood topic. If a sequel were forthcoming as the conclusion suggests, I would happily delve into it. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss7.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_47635737" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_47635737">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_47635737" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_47635737" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_47635737"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/Cecilturtle" target="_top">Cecilturtle</a> | Jul 11, 2009 |  <a href="/review/47635737"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45830487" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>The Gnostic Mystery by Randy Davila<br><br>Draft, delayed due to family matters: A difficult book to review.

After a slow start (attributed to my attempt to read the first 5 chapters in several separate sittings) I finally began the book again and read it in one afternoon. The novel has "hidden" symbolism (numbers, music, etc.) yet deals with the current mid-east situation (suicide bombers - shocking to Americans but day-to-day life for local citizens)accurately. Davila weaves the ancient and the modern with cords of supposition and ribbons of clarity into a tapestry that will fuel the flames of religious debate. Like others in the religious mystery genre, such as "Skeleton in God's Closet" and "The DaVinci Code," Gnostic Mystery's "heresy" challenges traditional teachings but like "The Shack" it underscores the reality that belief (faith) makes all the difference. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss8.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45119418" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45119418">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45119418" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45119418" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45119418"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/polar-library" target="_top">polar-library</a> | Jun 27, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45119418"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_47038260" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>Randy Davila’s <i>The Gnostic Mystery</i> opens with an intriguing epigraph on teachers, disciples and secret knowledge; but that epigraph is some of the best writing between these covers.<br><br>Giving credit where credit is due, the author has conceived a good story; the plot outline is reasonable, believable and controlled; and parts of the story are told well. Furthermore, he draws clear distinctions between the faiths and teachings of two early Christian groups, the Gnostics, ultimately persecuted as heretics, and the orthodox “Literalists”, who prevailed with the support of (and supporting) the Roman Emperor Constantine. The accomplishments are commendable for any “religious faith” fiction, where awful books abound. But, ultimately, much of the story is underdeveloped, and this book suffers from want of a heavy editorial hand.<br><br>The results feel careless at times, and defects detract from the story’s potential: plot progression is formulaic; characters are not engaging; and potentially exotic settings get conventional, utilitarian treatment. What might be rewarding story-craft becomes transparent technique; and expositions of concepts, which are essential to a reader’s understanding, become recitals of successive details that seem lifted from travel guides, cooking instruction manuals, or Wikipedia. Several word choices and narrative comments are notably inappropriate, diverting the reader’s attention from an attractive young woman, the mysteries of a foreign place, or a character’s realization of deeper understandings.<br><br>The central character, Jack Stanton, is an American businessman, reportedly quite capable and accomplished in his working life, but personally unfulfilled, dissatisfied, and facing a crisis of unexamined faith. In practice, he comes across as shallow, ill-informed and unobservant – at best, a convenient organizational device, haplessly in the right place at the right time, taking logically necessary next-steps to advance the plot into the next chapter. But Jack never seems likely to contribute meaningful action to the story, even as developments would challenge his long-held beliefs to their core; we miss any breadth or depth of self-examination and personal growth, even as Jack is (supposedly) confronted with new truths and insights about himself and his faith.<br><br>Jack’s circle of friends and the interactions among them are wooden and artificial. The reader occasionally gets a view of personal thoughts, but without insight; instead, their “reflections” are stereotypical and fall flat. Dialogue is stilted and, for the most part, predictable – except where a pair of academics inexplicably and repeatedly interjects “A very good point,” “Well said,” or similar comments, each as the other outlines his or her expertise in private conferences with Jack. And once the reader recognizes the stylistic convention of Sherlock Holmes’ “Elementary, my dear Watson, elementary!” – for the third time (in the first half of the book!) – the particular device loses any dramatic effect it may have had.<br><br>The most lively and sympathetic parts of the novel focus on six minor characters, who nonetheless set the action in motion and play pivotal roles as it unfolds. In two young Palestinian boys, a teen-aged cousin and his girl, and a shopkeeper and his assistant, the author demonstrates a light, naturalistic touch and deft story-telling, evidencing something of what <i>The Gnostic Mystery</i> might have been. Details of these characters’ lives get little or no exposition; but the lack of attention actually enriches their inter-related stories, as if one good tale embedded in marble-block were waiting for Michelangelo to chip everything else away.<br><br>Finally, with marketing comments and blurbs on the cover, the publisher of <i>The Gnostic Mystery</i> inevitably invites comparison to Dan Brown’s <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>. For all of <i>DVC</i>’s over-blown hype to “change 2,000-years of world history as we know it,” that novel conveys excitement, mystery and adventure in its telling. The author of <i>The Gnostic Mystery</i> apparently would write in the same genre, using comparable materials (“mystery arising from suppressed secrets of the early Christian Church”), academic detection, and pursuit of ancient relics as his model. But the execution falls short of Brown’s popular success. For <i>The Gnostic Mystery</i>, the comparison is unfortunate at best, and <i>DVC</i>-style rhetoric seems cynical or mercenary. Thinking of <i>DVC</i> in terms of Churchill’s Russia (“a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma”), <i>The Gnostic Mystery</i> is more like Bemelman’s <i>Madeline</i>: “That’s all there is; there isn’t any more.” <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss4.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_47038260" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_47038260">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_47038260" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_47038260" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_47038260"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/jasbro" target="_top">jasbro</a> | Jun 27, 2009 |  <a href="/review/47038260"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45672477" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>There should be tremendous potential in a story about a wealthy American investment consultant who makes a pilgrimage to Israel in the hope of recovering his Roman Catholic faith, who while travelling with his college roomate, Punjeeh (whose once devout faith has lapsed) purchases a mysterious ancient scroll, which once translated, leads them, now in the company of Chloe Eisenberg, a brilliant professor of Religion and Philosophy - on a search for the second scroll. <br><br>However, the potential fails to materialize and the result is one dimensional characters poorly realized and a lecture on Gnosticism, awkwardly delivered. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss2.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45672477" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45672477">1</span> <img title="1 member found this review helpful" id="rvi_45672477" alt="vote" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/voteup-y.gif"></span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45672477" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45672477" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45672477"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/lyncos" target="_top">lyncos</a> | Jun 21, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45672477"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45764896" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>Randy Davila - Please get more depth in your writing - The ending for anyone having a knowledge of gnosticism was too predictable and formulaic for my taste - I could write the ending after the first few pages...

In it an old man tried to convince a young man to accept fundamentalist (or <i>literalist</i>, to use another term) Christianity. But the young man had a slightly older friend who derided literalist Christianity in favour of a more 'modern' take, one where if you just obeyed the ten commandments and the golden rule, you could basically disregard the rest, since "our most modern accredited, theologians" admit that the Bible is a human product and thus flawed and full of contradictions. The young man accepted his older friend's interpretation. <br><br><br><br>After their car was struck by a train, the young man and his friend found themselves in hell. The young man was understandably upset and turned on his friend claiming it was his fault they were in this mess. However, his friend was actually a demon who peeled off his human mask and corrected him saying, "No, little buddy, I wasn't wrong! You were wrong! You didn't accept Jesus Christ as your own lord and personal saviour!"<br><br><br><br>How pleased I was to discover that this splendidly representative artifact of fundamentalist (or <i>literalist</i>) Christianity was not only still in print, but that the <a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0003/0003_01.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_top">entire thing</a> is available for free online at the <a href="http://www.chick.com/default.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_top">Chick Publications web site</a>.<br><br><br><br>I hadn't thought of that old comic for years, until I was reminded of it recently reading Randy Davila's <i>The Gnostic Mystery</i>. About half way through it occurred to me that it could very well end with the character of Chloe ripping off her human mask and saying to the character of Jack "Haw, haw, you allowed me to lure you off the straight and narrow literalist path and through the mists of Gnosticism and the mystery religions into the fires of damnation! Bwa ha ha ha ha ha!" <br><br><br><br>As it turns out, Chloe is not a demon. But <i>The Gnostic Mystery</i> is very much a comic book, or at least the text from one. The characters are two dimensional and serve primarily to allow the author to expound on his ideas about the origins of Christianity. This is especially true of the character of Professor King, a stock, patronizing, university professor character who exists for no other purpose at all but to expound these theories. <br><br><br><br>This is not necessarily a bad thing. It is as it stands, since this comic book is trying to pass itself off as a novel, but were it to be illustrated it would be something of a cross between a Chick tract and one of those 'Introducing ... ' books that used to be titled '... for Beginners' but had to change their name to avoid conflict with an American publisher using the same series title.<br><br><br><br>In its current form, the audience for this is pretty much limited to young adults who haven't given this area of study much attention, especially if they have a traditional Christian background. Older readers may be more demanding, and anyone who has an interest in Gnosticism and the early church will likely find the material somewhat shallow. <br><br><br><br>But just about everyone likes those 'Introducing ...' or 'For beginners' books. And the shtick value of Chick tracts makes them entertaining, even for people very much opposed to fundamentalist Christianity. If you've got the text of a comic book, why not actually make it one? As a novel it rates about 3 out of 10 if that, but as a comic it could be a 7.5 or higher depending on the illustrations. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss2.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_46581797" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_46581797">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_46581797" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_46581797" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_46581797"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/fyoder" target="_top">fyoder</a> | Jun 17, 2009 |  <a href="/review/46581797"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45113795" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>Jack, a successful investment consultant who feels that something is missing in his life, decides to visit Israel with the hope of re-igniting his lasped Roman Catholic faith. He arrives at the home of his college roommate Punjeeh, who had always been a staunch Catholic, only to find that Punjeeh's faith has been shaken by his observations that "beliefs" have caused great suffering in the world. <br><br>At about the same time, a couple of Palestinian boys have discovered two ancient scrolls, one of which is purchased by Jack. The translation of this scroll leads them on a quest to obtain the second scroll, in the company of the knowledgeable Chloe, a professor of religion who proceeds to instruct them in the fallacies of their belief in the Gospels.<br><br>As a basic explanation of gnosticism, an exploration of mythology which found its way into the Bible, and a discussion of manipulation by the Roman Catholic Church, this book has some merit. As a novel, it utterly fails. <br><br>The dialogue is ludicrous, alternating between corny, ignorant and obnoxious questions and wise-cracks and pedantic exposition. The characterization is minimal and ridiculous: can we really believe that Jack, after 12 years of parochial school, has difficulty recalling the story of Abraham and Isaac? The basic premise, that belief in the Gospels, as promulgated by the Church, is erroneous and destructive, is quixotically replaced by an opposing belief: that the Gospels are erroneous, the truth deliberately obscured by the Church. The conclusion -- the text of the fictional second scroll – is so obviously fantasy that, rather than elucidating or supporting the previous theological discussions, many of which have considerable merit, it tends to discredit them.<br><br>It is unfortunate that Randy Davila, a recognized theological scholar, chose to present his knowledge and beliefs in the framework of a very bad novel. He has the ability – shown in the expository segments of the conversations – to clearly and simply explain gnosticism, other Christian and non-Christian myths and beliefs, and Church history. I would much rather have read a non-fiction essay exploring these topics and his resulting beliefs about Christianity. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss4.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45113795" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45113795">2</span> <img title="2 members found this review helpful" id="rvi_45113795" alt="vote" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/voteup-y.gif"></span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45113795" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45113795" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45113795"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/ivyd" target="_top">ivyd</a> | Jun 13, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45113795"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_46376452" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>This book would have been much better if it had left the little chunks of fiction completely out of it.

I really, really tried. I was offended by what a pedantic lecture this book is by page 62, and I kept reading out of a sense of responsibility. By page 128, I just couldn't stand it any more. Not only does Davila's presentation hit the reader over the head with a two-by-four of lectures about Gnosticism, he does so by making his characters the stupidest people alive. Jack, the protagonist, is supposed to have had 12 years of Catholic education, and yet having had the same amount of Catholic education myself, I find it impossible to believe he doesn't know some very basic information, according to Davilia. For example, the fact that the Virgin Birth refers to the birth of Jesus, and the Immaculate Conception refers to the Catholic traditional belief that Mary was conceived without Original Sin. Okay, so maybe that's an esoteric point that lots of people are confused about, My point it that Davilia is completely condescending to the reader when it comes to imparting historical information (and even Davilia gets the Virgin Birth/Immaculate Conception thing wrong, so he has no leg to stand on when it comes to his condescention). <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss2.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45912254" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45912254">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45912254" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45912254" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45912254"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/eggsnhm" target="_top">eggsnhm</a> | Jun 11, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45912254"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_46302740" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>This is an Early Reviewers book. It is similar to Sophie's World in that it presents sophomoric lecture material thinly wrapped in a plot device to allow the characters to deliver their soliloquies. But it is not as well crafted as Sophie's world, and the characters are little more than caricatures. <br><br>The book has an odd format, an odd size, and uses annoyingly large typefaces with poor leading and unbalanced whitespace and margins. I can't believe that a print designer approved that layout: I wonder about the small press publisher.<br><br>About one third of the way in, I abandoned hope that a real story would emerge from the lectures, and settled in to absorb the lecture material. Overall the Gnostic history is fairly well presented, but as another reviewer noted: who is the intended audience? Devout Christians in the literal tradition won't be swayed, and anyone interested in Gnosticism will have better sources to choose from. The bibliography at the end may be of use to any readers looking for more information. Like the author I studied religion and the Bible as literature and most of the material was review. But there was some new material, and it was not an unpleasant means of getting a refresher.<br><br>There is a brief passage towards the end where we get a glimpse into life in a Palestinian settlement, that was actually interesting in and of itself; but it is over all too soon, and the characters are never fully realized.<br><br>The hyperbolic reviews and comparison to Dan Brown's work are not useful; they serve only to set up the reader for disappointment. This is not a thriller. I might recommend this as a first year university text in a survey of religion, or as an easy introduction to early Christian history, but it is neither a comprehensive textbook nor an engaging work of fiction. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss5.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_46302740" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_46302740">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_46302740" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_46302740" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_46302740"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/rosses" target="_top">rosses</a> | Jun 10, 2009 |  <a href="/review/46302740"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_46251983" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>Years ago, after watching the movie Stigmata, I became interested in learning more about the Gnostic scrolls found at Nag Hammadi. So, when I received The Gnostic Mystery I was anxious to read it. <br><br>The back cover claims that the book is “threaded with the searing realities of today’s Middle East”. Speckled would have been a better word to use instead of threaded. Davila touches on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, but mostly in conversation between characters. There is really only one “action” scene in the whole story and the author does not expand much on it. Another blurb on the back cover claims it “combines the shrewd detective work of The Da Vinci Code”. There is no detective work at all. The whole story is one character educating the other characters on Gnosticism by lecturing to them. <br><br>The author could have done a better job with the protagonist, Jack Stanton. Stanton is very naïve, despite the fact that he is a self-made multi-millionaire. It is very difficult to come to terms with the fact that this character, which is shrewd enough to reach such a high financial peak, could be so stupid about common knowledge. Being what I call “vaguely” Catholic myself, I found it was also hard to believe that Stanton knew so little about the basic tenets of the religion and Christianity as a whole. Stanton’s interactions with his best friend, Punjeeh, and love interest, Chloe, are extremely awkward. I cringed as I read the dialogue between Stanton and Punjeeh and Stanton’s inner-dialogue around Chloe. I imagined that in real life a person like Stanton’s character would come across as more confident in himself. <br><br>Readers expecting from this book an adventure that spans time and place will be very disappointed. This book is more of a religious conversation, a basic introduction to Gnosticism. All the information the author put into this book truly fascinated me. The book contains a bibliography that will come in handy for readers like me, who are interested in learning more about Gnosticism. <br><br>At some point, I began to ignore the author’s shortcomings plot- and character-wise and focused on the facts outlined by the story. This was the way I was able to enjoy the book. Overall, I think the misleading back cover, the flimsy plot, and the poorly thought-out characters do a great disservice to the book. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss6.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_46251983" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_46251983">1</span> <img title="1 member found this review helpful" id="rvi_46251983" alt="vote" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/voteup-y.gif"></span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_46251983" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_46251983" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_46251983"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/Zeesosa" target="_top">Zeesosa</a> | Jun 10, 2009 |  <a href="/review/46251983"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_46245365" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>The Gnostic Mystery: In a word; sanctimonious.

The plot is secondary to the religious agenda and it seems like the author abandons elements of it near the end in favor of continuing the diatribe. There is even an epilogue that has absolutely no connection to the story whatsoever but only serves to continue the "discussion." Horribly one sided, boring, and inaccurate.

This will serve them well. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss6.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45887682" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45887682">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45887682" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45887682" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45887682"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/suefernandez" target="_top">suefernandez</a> | Jun 1, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45887682"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45884695" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>The Gnostic Mystery is an introductory course on Gnosticism wrapped in a very thin story. The book is quite short and only a small portion of it is devoted to the plot which revolves around a pair of ancient Gnostic scrolls found near the Dead Sea. The majority of the novella focuses on lectures on Gnosticism and early Christianity by one or more characters, usually in a softball Q&amp;A format with another character. Still, I rated this book three stars because it provides a lot of basic information on the Gnostic/Literalist split of the early church in an easy to understand format. I wish that the author had written a nonfiction tome instead of doing his knowledge of the subject such a disservice by enclosing it in such a forgettable story. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss6.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45884695" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45884695">1</span> <img title="1 member found this review helpful" id="rvi_45884695" alt="vote" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/voteup-y.gif"></span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45884695" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45884695" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45884695"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/bane47" target="_top">bane47</a> | Jun 1, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45884695"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45880452" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>The Gnostic Mystery appears to be a work of fiction.

It at least brings up an interesting view in an easy to read format.<br><br>6/17/09 Update: Weeks after finishing the book, a concept the author presented that he termed "beliefs" and the source of the misery that religion often causes (with direct reference to the conflict in the middle east) has certainly stuck with me.

This book is a history lesson thinly dressed with a story. If you have never delved into the history of Christianity, this book is for you. This is a quick read of a very condensed history and it's incredibly interesting. If, you are well versed in the origins of the religion, I must tell you there is nothing new here. I do appreciate his views on conflict(s) caused by religion; here he makes several valid points, reminding me of one of my favorite quotes: <br><br>"At least two-thirds of our miseries spring from human stupidity, human malice and those great motivators and justifiers of malice and stupidity: <br>idealism, dogmatism and proselytizing zeal on behalf of religious or political <br>ideas."~ Aldous Huxley <br><br>However, while I appreciate Mr. Davila's attempt to convey the information in a highly accessible manner, I was disappointed that he couldn't bring more excitement and mystery to the fictional story that surrounds it. Perhaps he didn't want to detract from the history lesson, in which case, maybe he should stick to non-fiction. <br><br><a href="http://girlsjustreading.blogspot.com/2009/05/jenns-review-gnostic-mystery.html" rel="nofollow" target="_top">http://girlsjustreading.blogspot.com/2009/05/jenns-review-gnostic-mystery.html</a> <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss6.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_44663085" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_44663085">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_44663085" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_44663085" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_44663085"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/jaharnick" target="_top">jaharnick</a> | May 26, 2009 |  <a href="/review/44663085"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45651971" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>The back cover creates expectation for something modeled on the Da Vinci Code.

It's more of a gnostic allegory. Unfortunately, lack of a story can keep a wide variety of people from being riveted, and can be used as ammunition against the author by irate, devout readers. <br><br>That said, I found the book was a page turner, but looking at Christianity from a historical standpoint is fascinating to me. I couldn't relate to any of the characters, since their whole purpose seemed to either ask questions or answer them, ultimately revealing a side of Christianity that will upset those who take the Bible literally. ("Literalists," as the book deems them.)<br><br>The plot does start out promising, but gets mungled up in confusing flashbacks. Millionaire Jack flies from America to visit his devout Catholic college roomie and ER doc Punjeeh in Jersualem with the ulterior motive of rekindling his lapsed faith. However, he arrives to find that Punjeeh has lost his own faith due to the horrors he's seen in the tumultuous Middle East. While on a visit to the Dead Sea, Jack is sold 2 ancient scrolls from a boy hoping to make a few bucks. The scrolls turn out to be worth so much more - and Punjeeh's friend, religion professor Chloe, helps them to understand that they are related to early Christianity and the Gnostics who hold a mystery to the life of Christ that the Literalists suppressed from the Bible. Meanwhile, the boy who sold the scrolls, Tariq, and his friends who found them in the first place try to get back their treasure.<br><br>The book reads more like a lecture than a suspense, but if you are open to it, it's not a totally bad read. The characters need to be fleshed out, and devout Christian characters need to be less malicious if to be taken seriously (like the Pastor Dan, who Jack, Punjeeh, and Chloe run into in Bethlehem. "Gnostics? Heretics!" he hisses. The scene is comical, albeit not how the author intended it.) Ultimately, it's the fascinating subject matter, not the weak characters or flimsy plot that carry the book. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss5.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45446876" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45446876">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45446876" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45446876" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45446876"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/StoutHearted" target="_top">StoutHearted</a> | May 23, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45446876"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45554497" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>The Gnostic Mystery is an intriguing tale that challenges the long-held beliefs of millions on all sides of the Middle East conflict.<br><br>I thought it unfortunate that the strong first paragraph is followed by some confusion as to whether this was to be a new meeting or reunion between protagonist Jack Stanton, and Professor Chloe Eisenberg.

The basic storyline was very simple and it employed cliché after cliché. I was surprised to read “He flashed his pearly whites.” What !? What sort of serious author would dare use so hackneyed a cliché as that? And this book had so many of them that I was surprised when it started in such an intense discussion on theology. <br><br>I was quite puzzled. And the language suddenly changed from a junior high level to a grad-school level. The arguments were mature and well planned out, then we’d jump back to the limp story that was too overburdened to carry the heavy weight of the authors true intention: convincing the reader that the Catholics were not the first Christians.<br><br>I also found the characters to be inconsistent. The main character, Jack, was described as a happy-go-lucky sort of frat boy. But in on instance he became angry and yelled at the woman teaching him about Gnostism, in a church no less. Now this should sound like a very interesting part of the story, but it was done so clumsily that it was a pain to read and it was out of character for Jack. There was no build up; there was no believability.<br><br>This book is the Davila’s first and I hope he learns how to write before he attempts another. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss1.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45480364" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45480364">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45480364" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45480364" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45480364"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/HRHSpence" target="_top">HRHSpence</a> | May 22, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45480364"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45502744" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>There is a kernel of an idea in this book.

This first novel's thin plot in which Jack Stanton visits his friend, Punjeeh, in Jerusalem and comes across an ancient scroll is essentially a framework for a dialogue among the four main characters regarding the early Christians known as Gnostics. <br>By fleshing out more on the current state of Jerusalem, descriptions of its landmarks, and a little more twists and turns in the plot, this novel would rise above a mere and at times simplistic examination of the Gnostics' impact on the early church. Nonetheless, for those interested in an accessible introduction to the Gnostics and early church history, this is an easy read.</div><div id="rfd_45483923" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45483923">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45483923" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45483923" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45483923"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/txmysterylover" target="_top">txmysterylover</a> | May 21, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45483923"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45467164" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>It would be easier to say that I would have enjoyed pulling my teeth and gouging out my eyeballs with dull rusty nails rather than read this book. I am giving it the lowest possible rating I can. <br>To start with, the cover is designed quite amateurishly, but that can be ignored. The characters were so flat, they were one-dimensional. About the only thing that makes the main character a top notch business man is that he forks over some cash twice in the book. The characters were really only there to react in a very cheezy way to the supposedly true explanations of Christianity. I am not going to go into the claims that the author makes because other people are better suited to that, however, all of the supposed truths are brought on with about as much logic as saying 2+2=5, why? because someone said so once upon a time. "Remarkable! Amazing!" I cannot believe that someone such as the character Punjeeh would simply drop any pretense and simply believe something because someone told him so. This is the entire book! It was a thinly disguised, poorly written persuasive essay done in supposed novel form. <br>Somehow I made myself finish this book, but I really wish I had not. Don't waste your time on Randy Davila's attempt to cash in on Dan Brown's gravy train.

HOWEVER, a novel was not the place for Davila to share the history of this religion. As non-fiction, I have no doubt this topic would have succeeded. As fiction, it fails. Plot is at a minimum, dialogue as at a maximum, and I cannot seem to care about the characters or their lives or their motivations. I found myself tapping my foot, aching for the characters to comprehend the significance of each fact provided by the religion professor character faster... it's as if the characters were too dim-witted to catch on to what was clear to me within seconds. (I swear I'm not tooting my own horn.) I suppose Davila chose a novel as his format to reach a wider audience, but his attempt at Da Vinci Code fails to deliver the epiphanies for which Dan Brown has become famous. The ending seemed too convenient and was very abrupt. Why was there even an epilogue? - seemed tacked on for no good reason. <br>**Sorry for the lack of continuity.** <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss4.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45104110" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45104110">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45104110" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45104110" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45104110"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/wowcaipora" target="_top">wowcaipora</a> | May 19, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45104110"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45413841" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>Not much of a plot here: a guy goes to Israel, purchases an ancient scroll from a Palestinian boy (who stole it from the cousin who actually found it), discovers that it was written by a Gnostic.

I find what I consider false advertising a sad thing because it could turn away people who would find this book fascinating, while making those who do stop to pick it up feel mislead.<br><br>Luckily, I read with a very broad mind so when the book turned out to be much different than my expectations, I accepted what had come into my hands as a mystery of a different sort, a book whose purpose and focus remained to be discovered.<br><br>Randy Davila does offer a story in this novel, though to call that tale a mystery is a bit of a stretch to my mind. The true mystery has nothing to do with the story itself, but rather is a voyage in which two characters explore what religion in general and Christianity in specific means to them personally and how that meaning is strengthened or changed by new understandings that unfold as they interact with a religious scholar and her colleague. These characters are brought together by a chance purchase of an ancient Gnostic scroll that opens new vistas for the main character and his friend.<br><br>The book itself is a thinly disguised thesis on the history of early Christianity and the Gnostic movement. The material is presented by Chloe, a professor of philosophy and religion in Jerusalem, who is asked to translate the scroll initially as a first move in the dating ritual. But soon this quest for answers becomes so much more than that as the foundation of Jack's and Punjeeh's understanding of Christianity is undermined.<br><br>Jack goes to Israel to visit his friend and come to terms with the emptiness he's found in his life. He expects to find the answers in the historical roots of the religion he was brought up in but which never quite captured his imagination. His friend and former college roommate has always been a devout Christian and so seems a reasonable guide. However, Jack soon learns Punjeeh has set aside the trappings of Christianity if not the teachings because he is horrified about what is being done in religion's name in the conflict between Arabs and Jews. As an Emergency Room doctor, he gets to see first hand the damage done to uphold different religious views.<br><br>The scroll and Chloe's explanations of both the Gnostic beliefs and what little is known about their historical presence challenge Jack and Punjeeh to question what they've always been told. They explore a different conceptualization of Jesus' life and the historical events accepted as true in the Bible, guided by Chloe's spoon feeding so that their worlds are not shaken so much all at once that they respond emotionally as opposed to considering the information for its value.<br><br>Rather than a quest for external treasure, this novel explores the religious beliefs and philosophies of the characters, offering information rarely considered outside of a scholarly environment and adamantly opposed by some Christian leaders, in a fiction framework that allows the reader to consider not only the revelations, but also the characters' reactions. I think Davila did a good job of making the characters likable and revealing the information in small enough doses that though I could see the thesis aspect, the characters kept me wanting to see their journey through in a way no academic text could have, even if I read it for the information alone.<br><br>In case you doubt my interpretation, at the end of the book are discussion questions worthy of any advanced literature or philosophy course concerning both symbolism within the text and your own positions regarding the information presented to the characters. The marketing may attempt to disguise its scholarly nature, but the study guide supports the author's apparent intent to educate.<br><br>Overall, I found <em>The Gnostic Mystery</em> fascinating. I'm a bit of an amateur philosopher and now I have to wonder where, in my rather unorthodox Catholic upbringing, I was exposed to Gnostic principles. The thoughts attributed to them here match rather well with my own religious ponderings, which seems an unlikely coincidence.<br><br>As a novelist, I feel Davila still has some growth to do. The balance between the thesis material and the tale that provided a vehicle was a little off, the resolutions too easy. Israel and Palestine provide a rich backdrop for these types of questions. I think the novel could have taken advantage of that fact more to build the narrative, and make the story as rich as the Gnostic discussions. However, this is his first novel-length work. Should he spend more time on the story in the future, and learn how to develop the complexity necessary for a novel plot, I think he will be able to offer many interesting works that explore philosophy and religion through the eyes of characters rich enough to avoid the lectures but reveal the same content.</div><div id="rfd_45395972" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45395972">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45395972" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45395972" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45395972"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/MarFisk" target="_top">MarFisk</a> | May 19, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45395972"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45383633" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>I got this in the mail two days ago and even though I was engrossed in another book, I started reading it out of idle curiosity. I knew about the Gnostic sect through my studies about religion and mythology in college. I'd also done some research on my own because religions and their origins are my chief interest besides philosophy, literature, and women's studies. To be honest, I was not prepared to like this book. I was slightly put off by its didactic tone as if the author was speaking to the slightly obtuse, but then I realized that to reach as wide an audience as possible with new and potentially difficult information, the tone was just about right. What wasn't right to me was the gratuitous stereotyping of women and size and conservative believers as devious and arrogant. However, these are minor points and more about writing style rather than content. I was not prepared to learn anything new, but I did learn a thing or two even after I thought I'd exhausted the topic to my own satisfaction. Still, I finished it in three days when I hadn't been able to finish a book for quite some time. There was enough there to keep me interested and the book flowed to the end in a satisfactory manner. Only minor modern political points between religious groups were touched on, but the focus was on church history and keeping that in mind, this book is not a bad first effort at all. In fact, it's a good way to introduce thoughtful alternatives to the open minded believer who has never really questioned her faith and what it's supposedly based on. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss6.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45383633" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45383633">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45383633" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45383633" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45383633"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/1000reads" target="_top">1000reads</a> | May 18, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45383633"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45386246" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>This book is very thought provoking.

Unfortunately, it mostly achieves their common denominator: poor writing. For example, here's a paragraph from the beginning of the third chapter, in which the lead character, a millionaire stock broker, is having a quarter-life crisis during a plane flight: "But now, at age thirty-three, after accomplishing most of the financial goals he had set out for himself, he had a restlessness inside him, a feeling of lack. It was as if somewhere in the back of his mind loomed the uncomfortable thought: Is this all there is?" So what is the 'out' doing there? Can one have a 'feeling of lack'? What's the difference between feeling 'as if' one has an uncomfortable thought versus actually having the uncomfortable thought? Throughout the book, the awkward writing makes it hard to stay focused on the story.<br><br>It's not necessarily the author's fault that the publisher has packaged this book as a thriller, but it's false advertising nonetheless, and it's likely to mean a sizable fraction of the book's readers come away unhappy. Four-fifths of the book is explication of two ideas -- that the Gospels aren't meant to be taken literally; and that a particular interpretation of gnostic philosophy can unlock special insights into the New Testament. Neither of these are emotionally compelling, at least not when the jacket promises a 'thrilling mystery'. It would be more accurate to say the Gnostic Mystery reads like a book-length version of the fictional chapter introductions I recall from high school history textbooks -- passages that were intended to add accessible color to dry historical fact, but instead felt patronizing and hokey. Oh well. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss4.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45176892" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45176892">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45176892" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45176892" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45176892"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/bezoar44" target="_top">bezoar44</a> | May 12, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45176892"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45177067" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>I love it when I learn new things while enjoying a good read.

But what's the point? It's in that odd modern genre, the educational thriller. The point of it is to wrap a history lesson in some action sequences; even if the characterization and prose here are below average even for books of this type, that's not necessarily a fatal flaw. In accepting the conventions of the form and choosing to read a book like this, I turn off my usual critical faculties and focus on the two questions that matter most: is the action compelling? and is the history lesson accurate? Alas, <i>The Gnostic Mystery</i> fails on both fronts.<br><br>Action. What action? As you might expect in such a novel, the characters have discovered one shocking ancient text and are on the trail of another, but the search for it involves nothing more interesting than driving around and chatting with tourists. The book only reaches the level of drama associated with this genre for one fleeting moment, and that development has more to do with the author's thematic heavy-handedness (of which more shortly) than with the creation of authentic tension.<br><br>History. The problem with any book that structures a mystery around ancient history and religion is that mysteries need clear resolutions, and the history of early Christianity is anything but clear. I'm willing to allow novels like this a certain amount of exaggeration and oversimplification: they're aimed at people who want some knowledge about the material, but aren't interested enough to actually pick up a history book. They don't need every little nuance. But <i>The Gnostic Mystery</i> goes beyond reasonable simplification, treating theories and speculations as obvious fact, creating rigorous distinctions that can't be proven, and in general wildly overstating our knowledge of "Gnosticism" and its development.<br><br>I don't want this review to be a history lesson, not least because I can't claim any degree of expertise in this material either. But you don't have to be an expert to recognize the problems with this novel's understanding of "Gnosticism," and it won't take much detail to explain them. You've noticed that I put the word in quotes. This is because it's not at all clear that the category "Gnostic" is a useful one. Apart from the denunciations of heretics by orthodox Christians alluded to in the novel, which are polemical texts by outsiders and therefore of uncertain validity in determining what early Christians thought, our only knowledge of "Gnosticism" comes from the Nag Hammadi texts, also mentioned in the novel. The problem is that these texts reflect a range of beliefs about nearly every topic. For example: the novel suggests that "Gnostics" regarded the crucifixion of Jesus as a metaphor, but some of these "Gnostic" texts treat it as a historical event, albeit one that may not have occurred as traditional Christianity suggests or meant what it seems to mean. The same is true for nearly every "fact" this novel presents about "Gnostic" beliefs and practices. In the absence of any core of recognizable Gnostic ideology, what good is it to talk about Gnosticism at all, or to contrast it with an "orthodox" Christianity (what the novel calls Literalism)?<br><br>If this is true, where does this book's conception of Gnosticism come from? In part, from older scholarship; the issues I mention have only been identified fairly recently, and earlier works on Gnosticism were very comfortable discussing Gnosticism from orthodox Christianity laying out a "Gnostic myth." And this scholarly invention appears to have been run through a New Age ringer before finding its way into <i>The Gnostic Mystery</i>, producing a highly fanciful modern-sounding religion that was egalitarian, highly spiritual and intellectual, and a little bit like philosophical Buddhism. These are nice things for a religion to be, as far as I'm concerned, but connections between this construct and actual early Christianity are purely coincidental.<br><br>The treatment of the tenuous and unproven connections among the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Essenes, and early Christians is likewise far too definitive; as elsewhere, the desire to provide a cohesive "secret history" of Christianity gets in the way of appropriate scholarly caution. The book does include some valid or at least defensible assertions: as far as I can see, its treatment of problems and ambiguities in traditional Christian narrative (the birthdate of Jesus, parallels from other religions, that sort of thing) is basically solid, though I'm not vouching for every detail and the underlying assumption that the earliest Christians were "Gnostic" rather than "Literalist" is faulty since both categories are meaningless.<br><br>That's probably enough lecturing from me, since I shouldn't expect readers to find undigested exposition as fascinating as Jack Stanton seems to. But this novels' dubious facts aren't just a problem in and of themselves; they're also the basis of <i>The Gnostic Mystery</i>'s glib theme, which is that violent conflict over religious matters is silly and that people should just accept their disagreements and get along. How novel. This great notion is applied not just to the long-ended conflict between "Gnostics" and "Literalists", but also to the current violence in Israel/Palestine, which this novel appears to believe is primarily between Jews and Muslims as such. I do hope I don't have to explain why this is embarrassingly short-sighted.<br><br>I hate to write a review that doesn't include at least some upside, but every point of praise I can come up with sounds like snark in disguise. ("At least it's short" and "The prose isn't so awful that you can't speed through it".) <i>The Gnostic Mystery</i> just doesn't work for me on any level. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss2.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45156995" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45156995">6</span> <img title="6 members found this review helpful" id="rvi_45156995" alt="vote" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/voteup-y.gif"></span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45156995" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45156995" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45156995"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/brendanmoody" target="_top">brendanmoody</a> | May 12, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45156995"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45051586" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>The concept of The Gnostic Mystery by Randy Davila was quite promising; an exploration of shocking truths that challenge widely-accepted beliefs in an explosive geographical setting has many of the elements of a darn good yarn built right in. The fact that I received the book as a free early review copy from the publisher further disposed me to want to like it and find good things to say about it. Unfortunately, as much as I hoped to provide a glowing review, I cannot do so in good conscience. The book simply failed to deliver on its promise. <br><br>	<br>The Gnostic Mystery has several failings. <br>1. The book doesn't work well as a mystery novel because of the lack of attention to character and plot development and an excessive focus on what amounts to a book-long argument for Christian skepticism.<br>2. The scholarship of the book is lacking, especially when it comes to the treatment of Gnostics, and the picture presented of traditional Christian religion is very one-sided, simplistic and incomplete.<br>3. The book doesn't seem to be written for a readily identifiable audience: it alternately treats the reader and the main characters as ignorant or gullible, rather than compelling introspection and doubt through intelligent presentation of supportable facts.<br>4. The book leaves one with the distinct feeling that it didn't manage to be what it set out to be -- of the spell-binding Dan Brown Spiritual Mystery ilk. <br><br>	<br>The Gnostic Mystery both fails to be a novel in any satisfying sense and it also fails to be a genuine mystery.<br>The narrative of the book is very thin, because the characters remain undeveloped and the mystery and action of the book are not given much importance. I think the book aims, rather, to be something of a Socratic dialogue, wherein the major players search for truth and find it by following difficult questions to the ultimate answers. The book does not accomplish this, because rather than having smart, engaging characters that interact meaningfully and with a gutsy give-and-take, there are essentially two poorly-conceived characters (Jack - the hopeful Catholic seeker, and Punjeeh - the disillusioned former Catholic), sadly lacking in basic knowledge of their own faith, who are lectured for the duration of the book by a third character, the "wise" professor Chloe, and sometimes by her sidekick Professor King. As an aside, Chloe, as portrayed in the book, would have been more credible as a mildly sexy middle school teacher who is proud of the nice effort of her eager learners than she is as a university professor from Greece, whose mindset is curiously and narrowly western given her background and whose mode of expression is decidedly unscholarly. Rather than discovering the truth by their own efforts, the two men are told the "truth" in a rather drawn-out and over-simplified manner that takes all of the excitement out of discovering the solution to the proposed "mystery" of the book. The plot, which ought to give the lecture-aspect of the book its reason to be, is predictable, plodding, and scarce -- it probably accounts for up only about 30 of the 197 pages of text.<br>	<br><br>Another way the book fails to live up to expectations is in its scholarship. <br>I have a degree in philosophy from UCLA and an interest in history, which means that the philosophical, religious and historical aspects of the book should have been some of its greatest selling points for me. Instead, I found the history to be an unskilled rehashing of several skeptical arguments against the validity and veracity of the established church, the existence and identity of the person of Jesus, and the justification of religious belief. The book, set rather clumsily in a geographical hotbed of religious tensions, also presents an espousal of a sort of feel-good pacifistic argument against established religion as the cause of human ills. It's a popular way to think these days, and the religiously-based violence we still see in the world is certainly deplorable, but I do not happen to uncritically agree with the skeptical viewpoints the author pounds in the pages of the book. I do, however, love to be challenged intellectually, so the fact that the book has this bent was not intrinsically a problem. The problem was in execution. If these ideas had been presented in the context of an intellectually stimulating, inspiring narrative whose characters I came to love and respect, I might have found the material compelling. <br>	Since it devotes so much time to exploration of history and religious thought, it seems fair to expect a certain level of balance and thoroughness. At first glance, there is a fairly impressive bibliography at the back of the book. Upon examination, it turns out to be primarily a list of books arguing against Christianity as we know it, with a few original sources (Eusebius, Justin Martyr, etc.) and a less-skeptical history or two thrown in for good measure. Again, this is not a problem in itself if the information in the book manages to be solid. The problem is that what one would expect to find in a book called The Gnostic Mystery is a collection of reputable books on historical Gnosticism (which is not, as the book seems to suggest, simply the more legitimate form of Christianity as it developed in the first century C.E.). In fact, that area of research is startlingly thin. Gnosticism has an impressive pre-Christian and non-Christian history, but as presented in the book, it is simplified and twisted into an uneasy, touchy-feely marriage of something resembling Locke’s political theory, Hindu-esque mysticism and 20th century psychology. Again, I wished the book had done Gnosticism justice, rather than simply using its focus on the hidden and secret, its dualism and its suppression by what became the mainstream of Christianity as devices to produce a "mystery" for the characters to unravel. In the actual pages, the original sources are alternately discredited or quoted indiscriminately to support a point. Additionally, the translated texts of the "scrolls" were extremely hard to swallow as 4th century texts, so I faced an almost insurmountable hurdle of incredulity as early as page 11.<br><br>	<br>The book also seems to lack a clearly-defined audience. <br>On the one hand, the subject matter is potentially quite deep, intellectual and ultimately attractive to those who already possess some interest in spiritual matters. On the other, the book dumbs-down and slants that same subject matter to a ridiculous degree. It could not have been written for people who are already savvy about religion and religious history; if it had been, it would have been at least 100 pages shorter because it would have dispensed with the basic western-Christian history and theology lessons, not to mention the liberal sprinkling of unsubstantiated (and un-cited) claims about historical persons and events. It cannot be written as a challenge for the believing Christian audience, because it lacks the respect for religious believers that is critical when it comes to opening a focused mind to a different paradigm. Instead, it takes the position that it shouldn't matter if all of your sacred cows are slaughtered and dumped bloody and shattered on your lap by skeptical theorists whose own views may or may not be substantiated by scholarship: if you aren't a complete idiot, you will accept the debunking and find comfort and peace in platitudes about how your discredited, undermined and possibly non-existent would-be savior still has a message that is beautiful and relevant to life. To me, how someone who didn't exist in any recognizable form still manages to be relevant to anything is the real mystery in the book, but that particular mystery the author doesn't touch. In short, the book assumes that the reader is ignorant and as willing to swallow the skeptical arguments wholesale as Jack and Punjeeh are in the story, so it is rather insulting to the intelligence of thinking people - especially if they happen to be religious. It must be written for people who are clueless about Christianity, which makes the audience rather narrow, at least in the United States.<br><br>	<br>In the end, the book seems to amount to an abortive attempt to cash in on Dan Brown's literary legacy. <br>It would seem that the author has big plans in that vein: the last few paragraphs even set the reader up for a sequel! I can tell you right now that I will not be picking up the sequel should it materialize, because I don't think the author is skillful enough to make the scholarship-inspired mystery novel work.<br><br>	<br>While I have done enough writing to appreciate the work and heart that must have gone into the crafting of the book, and I still think the concept really was a good one, it pains me to say that I can't encourage the production of more of the same. I believe Mr. Davila ought to leave the Spiritual Mystery genre to Dan Brown and others who have figured out how to make it work. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss2.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_45051586" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_45051586">1</span> <img title="1 member found this review helpful" id="rvi_45051586" alt="vote" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/voteup-y.gif"></span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_45051586" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_45051586" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_45051586"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/carolinachronicles" target="_top">carolinachronicles</a> | May 9, 2009 |  <a href="/review/45051586"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_45046714" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>This is an easy read for a person who doesn't know anything about early christianity.

First and foremost, it tries to be a religious tractate. Second, and only secondarily, it tries to put these ideas into a dramatic format a la The daVinci Code.<br><br>First, as to the dramatic content-- it's just not there. The dialogue is stilted, relentlessly expository, and poorly organized. The general impression I got was that the author didn't really want to bother with it because he was more interested in getting his point across. The net effect is that the dramatic elements read like the filler between sex scenes in a porn story.<br><br>Despite its comparison (in a review on the back) it only hopes to be as intruguing as The daVinci Code. I did not think The daVinci Code was that well-written, but none thing it did well was it created real tension as to what the secret was that was being hidden. In this book, the game is given away at the very outset-- and the author's choice to keep skipping around in time only serves to jumble the exposition which is clearly the author's main objective.<br><br>As for the material presented itself, it's laughably misinformed. The author obviously favors Gnosticism over what he calls the "Literalism" (what we might call Orthodoxy), but his conception of Gnosticism is not historically accurate.

LOL Honestly the book reads like somebody giving a lecture to a bunch of idiots constantly having to give little bits of the story so their feeble brains can grasp the importance of what is said before moving on. The conversations and character reactions are unrealistic in their presentation and character development is not even considered, and the ending come on what the heck. I had better hopes for the book because I do have an interest in the Gnostics but, wow, I am still reeling from the poor treatment. I literally had to put the book down at one point because of the terrible handling of the conversations and laugh. Honestly I think my 2 1/2 stars may be to much for this book but I am feeling nice today. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss5.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_44903153" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_44903153">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_44903153" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_44903153" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_44903153"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/Loptsson" target="_top">Loptsson</a> | May 8, 2009 |  <a href="/review/44903153"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_44978422" class="commentText"><div class="birdnotice alwaysblue"><a href="/er/list"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/bird-tiny.gif"></a>This review was written for <a href="/er/list">LibraryThing Early Reviewers</a>.</div>Librarything thought I wouldn't like it, and they were right. First off, the theological premise was not one that I agreed with, but second, the writing was clunky and the action was non-existent.

This is not a good book. The author is obviously well educated in theology and has a particular pension for the Gnostics--believing that they have been unduly persecuted by the Catholics. Catholics take a big hit in this book, both as a religion as well as in the literal belief system. For those of you who are familiar with the Gnostic Gospels, nothing in this book will be new. For those of you who are amused when Catholicism gets picked on, you may want to read the book. For those of you who picked the book up because the publisher promoted it as a "DaVinci Code-esque" adventure . . . don't bother. The narrative is incredibly weak. There are bits and pieces that have potential but it would take four years of intensive study in Creative Writing with the best teachers to draw it out. I cannot figure out why an academic scholar in theology would weaken his credibility to write such a novel. Perhaps this author thought he'd be able to "get the message out." This, however, makes me even less likely to give him a break. Writing novels with a hidden agenda to convert people's religious beliefs is inexcusable. No real novelist would attempt it. Go back to teaching religion class. <span class="rating">( <img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/ss2.gif"> )</span></div><div id="rfd_44712675" class="reviewFlagDialogBox"></div><div class="commentFooter"><span class="reviewMods"><span class="reviewVoteInfo"><span class="reviewVoteCount" id="rvc_44712675">&nbsp;</span> </span><!-- reviewVoteInfo --><span class="reviewFlags"> <img id="rfi1_44712675" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"> <img id="rfi2_44712675" src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/flag-trans.gif"><span id="rfrf_44712675"> </span></span></span> <!-- reviewMods --><span class="controlItems"><a href="/profile/plettie2" target="_top">plettie2</a> | Apr 30, 2009 |  <a href="/review/44712675"><img src="http://pics.cdn.librarything.com/pics/permalink.gif" width="16" height="7" /></a></span> <!-- controlItems --></div> <!-- commentFooter --></div> <!-- comment --><div class="bookReview"><div class="commentHeader"></div> <!-- commentHeader --><div id="brtext_42722474" class="commentText">This book was truly enlightening.

I think the book takes the stance of: Here's some things that happened in The Bible and here's what people believe about them. One more than one occasion it is mentioned that just because it is believed that some don't count The Bible as an accurate historical account does it make Jesus' teachings any less valuable?
