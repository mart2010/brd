- the 500 first reviews harvested from goodreads may have partial text (issue with the first incomplete tag)
- Adjust the lang reference tsv file so that I no longer miss lookup (i.e. get work_info.ori_lang_code = '--')
- Add a class to handle generically xpath extraction from selector
- See if I can generalize harvest logic by adding composition class for harvest logic
- Add interna AZ sites...
