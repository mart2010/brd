- the 500 first reviews harvested from goodreads may have partial text (issue with the first incomplete tag)
- Adjust the lang reference tsv file so that I no longer miss lookup (i.e. get work_info.ori_lang_code = '--')
- Add a class to handle generically xpath extraction from selector
- See if I can generalize harvest logic by adding composition class for harvest logic
- Add interna AZ sites...


- Particularity of Data loading for Goodreads:
    - initial harvest review done time DESCENDING (newest first) for work_id from 17 to 4194
    - after that, initial harvest review done time ASCENDING (to avoid issues of missing reviews), but:
            --> TODO: reset the last_harvest_dts in mapping (= max(review_date) + 1 ) before incremental load
